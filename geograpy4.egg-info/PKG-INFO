Description: TODO: One TODO is left in this version of Geograpy, which is being able
        to handle names as establishment (ie St’George’s Square). This message
        will be removed when this feature is added.
        
        Geograpy4
        =========
        
        Geograpy4 improves upon the work of Geograpy3,2, and 1 by allowing for
        the search of facility names within a city, country, or region. For
        example, an input of “I like union station in Washington and New York”
        will return both the addresses Union Station in DC and NY, instead of
        just the name of the city, country, and region.
        
        Geograpy4 also improves upon how these are grabbed, the previous
        version’s code now help in the building of queries to search in
        Nominatim via GeoPy. This will now allow for users to get complete
        location data in line with GeoPy’s geocoder raw return values, which
        contains much more data than what was currently returned by Geograpy3.
        
        Functionalities are different from Geograpy3,2, and 1. For those who are
        familar with the previous versions, there is no more return for a places
        object where you can get cities, regions, or countries. This is because
        complete address is now returned in an array, or the complete raw
        geocoded data of which you can build a DataFrame out of and query
        everything you need and then more.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        Grab the package using ``pip`` and ``git`` (this could take a few
        minutes) Try using one of the following:
        
        ::
        
           1. pip install git+git://github.com/jmbielec/geograpy3.git 
           2. pip install git+https://github.com/jmbielec/geograpy3.git 
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        Import the module, give a URL or text, and presto.
        
        ::
        
           import geograpy4
           input = "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26919928"
           more_places = geograpy4.get_place_context(input)
        
        or
        
        ::
        
           import geograpy4
           input = "Perfect just Perfect! It's a perfect storm for Nairobi"
           more_places = geograpy4.get_place_context(input)
        
        Other optional parameters for get_place_context are: **addressOnly=False
        (Return array of addresses (True) or raw geocoded data (False))**
        **ignoreEstablishments=True (Returns only the country,city,region data
        (True) or add possible establishment data as well (False))**
        
        Note that the return values for ignoreEstablishments=False are currently
        not as good as I hope it to be, and I will be improving upon it in the
        future
        
        Advanced Usage
        --------------
        
        Advanced usages are removed. Requests may be considered to add.
        
        Opening a Ticket
        ----------------
        
        If you have found a bug or issue in Geograpy4, please submit a ticket to
        the Issues tab above, and describe in as much detail as possible all
        circumstances, inputs, and outputs surrounding said bug. Thank you for
        your help!
        
        Developers
        ----------
        
        When creating a new branch that corresponds to an Issue, please include
        the Issue number at the end of the branch name.
        ``Example: find-entities-fix-5 would correspond to Issue number 5 regarding the find_entities() method not working.``
        
        When creating a new pull request, again reference/link the Issue number
        the pull request is fixing so that Issues can be closed after merging.
        
        For branches/pull requests unrelated to Issues, please use standard
        naming conventions and accurately describe the scope and goal of your
        code. If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask, thank you!
